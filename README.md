# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

After the initial data analysis where we summarized ride counts, average fares, and driver counts
across urban, suburban, and rural cities, our CEO V. Isulaize assigned a new project of analyzing the
fares across weekly timespan. To do this, we used Matplotlib and Pandas to help visualize data from
the beginning of January to the end of April, culminating in a triple line graph of each line representing
a city type. Let's look at the data.

## Results

Based on the chart, we cannot see any major differences between the three city types on a week to week basis.
What we do see is a greater variance in urban and suburban city types; there is a much larger gap between the 
lowest point in January, and the highest points showing sometime during late February. Not much can be said 
as far as recommendations for increasing profit. As you move closer to the city, you see more rides, more
drivers, and higher total fares. However, moving further away, we see average fares increase per ride and
per driver in rural areas. Does this mean increase our driving force in rural areas? I would not think so;
more likely we are simply seeing the nature of the rural geography; it tends to take longer to get from
point A to point B in the country side, as businesses, schools, and homes are more spread out. 

## Summary

The data shown above is just an extension of the larger analysis we did prior to the assignment, where we 
concluded that there seems to be a balance between urban and rural city types; to increase profitability,
we may need to look into what factors drive consumers to use ride sharing services? Where do they typically 
go? As a prior ride share provider myself, I can say that while a driver can make more profit in these 
longer trips, they occur less frequently. Perhaps we need to find ways to incentivize our service?
All in the future to come!
